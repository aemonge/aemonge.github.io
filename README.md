### Profile {#profile}

I translate KPI's into technically requirements and tasks, detailed enough to be ready to code and abstract enough to be fully described in a business and functional language. With a full background in developing and leading I can successfully teach, coach and sustain a productive Dev team to build solutions to match the desired KPI's or any other objective.

I translate requirements and mock-ups into fully functioning applications, solutions and features using the right mix of front-end (JavaScript) and back-end (Rails, nodeJS, mongoDB) technologies. As a architectural product owner my task is to identify key components and norms that will accelerate developers teams to build a more stables, robust and attractive software. As an architect I have to provide the right balance between results and maintainability, keeping up to date clients quality and quantity expectations. As a developer I invest the time making the tools to aide developers, verify correctness for following best practices, good TDD and company values.

_I also carry the electronic version of the curse of Cassandra. I'm able to see the future of technology and any project, due to my has a clear vision of the risks and strengths of all software life cycle_
